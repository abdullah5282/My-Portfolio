React
Here is a possible short intro for your personal react portfolio:

Hello and welcome to my personal react portfolio. My name is [your name] and I am a web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and interactive web applications using React. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows me to create reusable components, manage state and props, and use hooks and custom hooks for complex functionality. I have experience in using various React tools and libraries such as React Router, Redux, Axios, Material UI, and more. In this portfolio, you will find some of the projects that I have worked on using React, along with their source code and live demos. You can also learn more about me, my skills, and my contact details. I hope you enjoy browsing through my portfolio and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback. Thank you for visiting! ðŸ˜Š
